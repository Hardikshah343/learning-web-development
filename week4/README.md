# REACT

**Static websites** are those websites whose content doesnt change once the website is loaded.
**Dynamic websites** are those websites whose content changes even after the website is loaded and not refreshed. Like clicking a button makes a content of page change.

We can definelty create static and dynamic webistes without using libraries like React, Vue, etc. but these libraries makes our life much easier.
One such feature of making website dynamic is **DOM Manipulation** which can be done simply by using JS as well. But as we saw even to update a simple content it takes lot of time and effort. (ref Todo App).
So libraries like React makes it easier and also many more reasons.
